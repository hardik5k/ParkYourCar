# ParkYourCar
An online parking reservation system built not only for drivers, but also for parking operators.
## WHY?
PYK provides a hassle free parking experience by allowing to find nearby parking spaces(all commercial, private, etc.) and book slots from anywhere.

This allows people to plan their long trips well in advance or keep their favourite everyday parking spots reserved. It will further prevent illegal parking and congestion on roads during busy hours as well as unnecessary encroachment.

Moreover, PYK allows parking operators( from small private owners to big complexes) to set up their parking model conveniently and register with our system. It can be a  crucial tool for monitoring and optimising their
Parking space capacity, adjusting traffic flow or analysing busy hours.  It will  further reduce their infrastructure cost by proving ticketless parking(saving a lot of paper as well :))and less human staff needed.
